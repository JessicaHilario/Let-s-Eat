    <h2>What is this:</h2>
    <p>
Let’s eat is an app that allows you to randomly generate restaurants based your preferences

From system vision:
The Let’s Eat! application purpose is to help people choose what restaurant they should go to. It will create a list of restaurants based on the filters the user has put in. Our application’s features will reduce the frustration of finding somewhere to eat, encourages users to experience somewhere new, and requires less memory space since the directions will pop up on the application as well. The main elements are the end users and the system because it is the basis of what our application is trying to accomplish.
